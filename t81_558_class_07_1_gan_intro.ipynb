    "A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning systems invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. [[Cite:goodfellow2014generative]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf) Two neural networks contest with each other in a game. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. For example, a GAN trained on photographs can generate new photographs that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics. Though originally proposed as a form of generative model for unsupervised learning, GANs have also proven useful for semi-supervised learning, fully supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.  \n",

    "This paper used neural networks to automatically generate images for several datasets that we've seen previously: MINST and CIFAR.  However, it also included the Toronto Face Dataset (a private dataset used by some researchers). These generated images are given in Figure 7.GANS.\n",
