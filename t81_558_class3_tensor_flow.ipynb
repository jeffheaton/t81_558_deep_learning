    "## Neural Network Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks were one of the first machine learning models.  Their popularity has fallen twice and is now on its third rise.  Deep learning implies the use of neural networks.  The \"deep\" in deep learning refers to a neural network with many hidden layers.  Because neural networks have been around for so long, they have quite a bit of baggage.  Many different training algorithms, activation/transfer functions, and structures have been added over the years.  This course is only concerned with the latest, most current state of the art techniques for deep neural networks.  I am not going to spend any time discussing the history of neural networks.  If you would like to learn about some of the more classic structures of neural networks, there are several chapters dedicated to this in your course book.  For the latest technology, I wrote an article for the Society of Actuaries on deep learning as the [third generation of neural networks](https://www.soa.org/Library/Newsletters/Predictive-Analytics-and-Futurism/2015/december/paf-iss12.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks accept input and produce output.  The input to a neural network is called the feature vector.  The size of this vector is always a fixed length.  Changing the size of the feature vector means recreating the entire neural network.  Though the feature vector is called a \"vector,\" this is not always the case.  A vector implies a 1D array.  Historically the input to a neural network was always 1D.  However, with modern neural networks you might see inputs, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1D Vector** - Classic input to a neural network, similar to rows in a spreadsheet.  Common in predictive modeling.\n",
    "* **2D Matrix** - Grayscale image input to a convolutional neural network (CNN).\n",
    "* **3D Matrix** - Color image input to a convolutional neural network (CNN).\n",
    "* **nD Matrix** - Higher order input to a CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to CNN's, the image input was sent to a neural network simply by squashing the image matrix into a long array by placing the image's rows side-by-side.  CNNs are different, as the nD matrix literally passes through the neural network layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially this course will focus upon 1D input to neural networks.  However, later sessions will focus more heavily upon higher dimension input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensions** The term dimension can be confusing in neural networks.  In the sense of a 1D input vector, dimension refers to how many elements are in that 1D array.  For example a neural network with 10 input neurons has 10 dimensions.  However, now that we have CNN's, the input has dimensions too.  The input to the neural network will *usually* have 1, 2 or 3 dimensions.  4 or more dimensions is unusual.  You might have a 2D input to a neural network that has 64x64 pixels.  This would result in 4,096 input neurons.  This network is either 2D or 4,096D, depending on which set of dimensions you are talking about!"

TensorFlow was originally developed by the Google Brain team for Google's research and production purposes and later released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on November 9, 2015.\n",
