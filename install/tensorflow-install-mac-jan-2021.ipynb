    "Deep Learning on a Mac is in a bit of a state of flux.  Mac has not supported NVIDIA GPUs since 2016. With this change, Mac was no longer a serious option for deep learning.  Additionally, as of Jun 25, 2017, TensorFlow version 1.2, support for GPU on the Mac version of TensorFlow was dropped.  However, all is not entirely lost on the Mac platform.  With the introduction of the M1 chip, Apple introduced essentially a system on a chip.  The new Mac M1 contains CPU, GPU, and deep learning hardware support.  Apple is making available a M1 build of TensorFlow.  This build is very new technology and will take some work to make run correctly at this point.  As of January, 2021, I have not yet worked with Apple M1. If you are interested in trying this technology,  you can read more here.  You must have one of the 2020, Mac M1 models to use this release.\n",

Anaconda directly supports Windows, Mac, and Linux.  Miniconda is the minimal set of features from the extensive Anaconda Python distribution.  Download Miniconda from the following URL:\n",
