There are usually a number of tell-tail signs that you are looking at a computer generated image.  One of the most obvious is usually the surreal, dream-like backgrounds.  The background does not look obviously fake, at first glance; however, upon closer inspection you usually can't quite discern exactly what a GAN generated background actually is.  Also look at the image character's left eye.  It is slightly unrealistic looking, especially near the eyelashes.\n",

    "Most of the neural networks create in this course have made use of the Keras sequence object.  You might have noticed that we briefly made use of another type of neural network object for the ResNet, the Model.

    "It is important to point out that these are not two specific types of neural network.  Rather, they are two means of constructing neural networks in Keras.  Some types of neural network can be implemented in either, such as dense feedforward neural networks (like we used for the Iris and MPG datasets).  However, other types of neural network, like ResNet and GANs can only be used in the Functional Model API."
