    "GANs can also be used to implement semi-supervised learning/training.  Normally GANs implement un-supervised training.  This is because there are no y's (expected outcomes) provided in the dataset.  The y-values are usually called labels.  For the face generating GANs, there is typically no y-value, only images.  This is unsupervised training.  Supervised training occurs when we are training a model to \n",

    "As you can see, supervised learning is where all data have labels.  Supervised learning attempts to learn the labels from the training data to predict these labels for new data.  Un-supervised learning has no labels and usually simply clusters the data or in the case of a GAN, learns to produce new data that resembles the training data.  Semi-supervised training has a small number of labels for mostly unlabeled data.  Semi-supervised learning is usually similar to supervised learning in that the goal is ultimately to predict labels for new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, unlabeled data would simply be discarded if the overall goal was to create a supervised model.  However, the unlabeled data is not without value.  Semi-supervised training attempts to use this unlabeled data to help learn additional insights about what labels we do have.  There are limits, however.  Even semi-supervised training cannot learn entirely new labels that were not in the training set.  This would include new classes for classification or learning to predict values outside of the range of the y-values.\n",

    "Semi-supervised GANs can perform either classification or regression.  Previously, we made use of the generator and discarded the discriminator.  We simply wanted to create new photo-realistic faces, so we just needed the generator.  Semi-supervised learning flips this, as we now discard the generator and make use of the discriminator as our final model.\n",

However, we also expand upon the real digits to include classes 0-9.  The GAN discriminator is classifying between the 0-9 digits and also fake digits.  A semi-supervised GAN classifier always classifies to the number of classes plus one. The additional class indicates a fake classification. \n",
