TensorFlow Versions
===================

TensorFlow versions happen often, nearly monthly.  They often change syntax and break things
that are based on TensorFlow.  This class is standardized on TensorFlow 0.12.2 (for this semester).

If you are installing directly to your computer, I suggest installing TensorFlow 0.12.2. 
This should only be done AFTER you have installed [Anaconda Python 3.5](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

TensorFlow can be installed on Windows, Mac and Linux using the following command:

```
pip install scipy
pip install sklearn
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install tensorflow==0.12.2
```
