    "\n",
    "A filter is a square-shaped object that scans over the image. A grid can represent the individual pixels of a grid. You can think of the convolutional layer as a smaller grid that sweeps left to right over each row of the image. There is also a hyper parameter that specifies both the width and height of the square-shaped filter. Figure 10.1 shows this configuration in which you see the six convolutional filters sweeping over the image grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional layer has weights between it and the previous layer or image grid. Each pixel on each convolutional layer is a weight. Therefore, the number of weights between a convolutional layer and its predecessor layer or image field is the following:\n",

    "```\n",
    "[FilterSize] * [FilterSize] * [# of Filters]\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, if the filter size were 5 (5x4) for 10 filters, there would be 250 weights.\n",

    "The above figure shows a convolutional filter with a size of 4 and a padding size of 1. The padding size is responsible for the boarder of zeros in the area that the filter sweeps. Even though the image is actually 8x7, the extra padding provides a virtual image size of 9x8 for the filter to sweep across. The stride specifies the number of positions at which the convolutional filters will stop. The convolutional filters move to the right, advancing by the number of cells specified in the stride. Once the far right is reached, the convolutional filter moves back to the far left, then it moves down by the stride amount and\n",

    "\n",
    "Some constraints exist in relation to the size of the stride. Obviously, the stride cannot be 0. The convolutional filter would never move if the stride were set to 0. Furthermore, neither the stride, nor the convolutional filter size can be larger than the previous grid. There are additional constraints on the stride (s), padding (p) and the filter width (f) for an image of width (w). Specifically, the convolutional filter must be able to start at the far left or top boarder, move a certain number of strides, and land on the far right or bottom boarder.

    "## Max Pooling Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Max-pool layers downsample a 3D box to a new one with smaller dimensions. Typically, you can always place a max-pool layer immediately following convolutional layer. The LENET shows the max-pool layer immediately after layers C1 and C3. These max-pool layers progressively decrease the size of the dimensions of the 3D boxes passing through them. This technique can avoid overfitting (Krizhevsky, Sutskever & Hinton, 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "A pooling layer has the following hyper-parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spatial Extent (f )\n",
    "* Stride (s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike convolutional layers, max-pool layers do not use padding. Additionally, max-pool layers have no weights, so training does not affect them. These layers simply downsample their 3D box input. The 3D box output by a max-pool layer will have a width equal to this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ w_2 = \\frac{w_1 - f}{s + 1} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The height of the 3D box produced by the max-pool layer is calculated similarly with this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ h_2 = \\frac{h_1 - f}{s + 1} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth of the 3D box produced by the max-pool layer is equal to the depth the 3D box received as input. The most common setting for the hyper-parameters of a max-pool layer are f =2 and s=2. The spatial extent (f) specifies that boxes of 2x2 will be scaled down to single pixels. Of these four pixels, the pixel with the maximum value will represent the 2x2 pixel in the new grid. Because squares of size 4 are replaced with size 1, 75% of the pixel information is lost. The following figure shows this transformation as a 6x6 grid becomes a 3x3:\n",

    "Of course, the above diagram shows each pixel as a single number. A grayscale image would have this characteristic. For an RGB image, we usually take the average of the three numbers to determine which pixel has the maximum value.\n",

    "\n",
    "Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. Residual learning was introduced to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. ResNet explicitly reformulates the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. On the ImageNet dataset this method was evaluated with residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. This technique can also be applied to the CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. \n",

    "The above code contains a function called **make_square** that ensures that each of the images have the same height and width.  Square images are particularly easy to deal with because each image will have the same aspect ratio.  There are several techniques that can be used to make an image square.  Fundamentally the image will either be cropped or padded to make it square. Padding adds extra space to the image to cause a square shape.  Cropping removes pixels (and therefore information) from the images to make them square. \n",
    "\n",
    "The technique above crops the images to make them square.  The row and column sizes are analyzed and the image is adjusted based on if the row or column size is smaller.  If there are fewer rows and than columns then the extra columns are dropped to cause the row and column count to be equal. Similarly, if there are fewer columns and than rows then the extra columns are rows to cause the row and column count to be equal. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each image in the set, the image is first adjusted to be square and then resized to the common size that we are forcing all images to be.  The resulting images are each added to a list.  The training data, at this point, is shown below."

    "# Part 6.5: Recognizing Multiple Images with Darknet\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are great at recognizing classifying a single item that is centered in an image.  However, as humans we are able to recognize many items in our field of view, in real-time.  It is very useful to be able to recognize multiple items in a single image.  One of the most advanced means of doing this is YOLO DarkNet (not to be confused with the Internet [Darknet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet).  YOLO is an acronym for You Only Look Once.  This speaks to the efficency of the algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Redmon, J., Divvala, S., Girshick, R., & Farhadi, A. (2016). [You only look once: Unified, real-time object detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640). In *Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition* (pp. 779-788).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image shows YOLO tagging in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DarkNet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/darknet-predictions.jpg \"DarkNet\")\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to run YOLO on live video streams.  The following frame is from the YouTube Video for this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DarkNet Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/yolo_video.png \"DarkNet Video\")\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see it is classifying many things in this video.  My collection of books behind me is adding considerable \"noise\", as DarkNet tries to classify every book behind me.  If you watch the video you will note that it is less than perfect.  The coffee mug that I pick up gets classified as a cell phone and at times a remote.  The small yellow object behind me on the desk is actually a small toolbox.  However, it gets classified as a book at times and a remote at other times.  Currently this algorithm classifies each frame on its own.  More accuracy could be gained by using multiple images together.  Consider when you see an object coming towards you, if it changes angles, you might form a better opinion of what it was.  If that same object now changes to an unfavorable angle, you still know what it is, based on previous information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does DarkNet/YOLO Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO begins by resizing the image to an $S \\times S$ grid.  A single convolutional neural network is run against this grid that predicts bounding boxes and what might be contained by those boxes.  Each bounding box also has a confidence in which item it believes the box contains.  This is a regular convolution network, just like we've seen privously.  The only difference is that a YOLO CNN outputs a number of prediction bounding boxes. At a high level this can be seen by the following diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The YOLO Detection System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/yolo-1.png \"The YOLO Detection System\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the YOLO convolutional neural networks is essentially a multiple regression.  The following values are generated for each of the bounding records that are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **x** - The x-coordinate of the center of a bounding rectangle.\n",
    "* **y** - The y-coordinate of the center of a bounding rectangle.\n",
    "* **w** - The width of each bounding rectangle.\n",
    "* **h** - The height of each bounding rectangle.\n",
    "* **labels** - The relative probabilities of each of the labels (1 value for each label)\n",
    "* **confidence** - The confidence in this rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output layer of a Keras neural network is a Tensor.  In the case of YOLO, this output tensor is 3D and is of the following dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S \\times S \\times (B \\cdot 5 + C)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The constants in the above expression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *S* - The dimensions of the YOLO grid that is overlaid across the source image.\n",
    "* *B* - The number of potential bounding rectangles generated for each grid cell.\n",
    "* *C* - The number of class labels that here are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value 5 in the above expression is simply the count of non-label components of each bounding rectangle ($x$, $y$, $h$, $w$, $confidence$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are $S^2 \\cdot B$ total potential bounding rectangles, the image will get very full.  Because of this it is important to drop all rectangles below some threshold of confidence.  This is demonstrated by the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The YOLO Detection System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/yolo-2.png \"The YOLO Detection System\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual structure of the convolutional neural network behind YOLO is relatively simple and is shown in the following image.  Because there is only one convolutional neural network, and it \"only looks once,\" the performance is not impacted by how many objects are detected. \n",
