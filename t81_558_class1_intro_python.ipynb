    "\n",
    "Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. By using a combination of advanced training techniques neural network architectural components, it is now possible to train neural networks of much greater complexity. This course will introduce the student to deep belief neural networks, regularization units (ReLU), convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. High performance computing (HPC) aspects will demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged both on graphical processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. Deep learning allows a model to learn hierarchies of information in a way that is similar to the function of the human brain. Focus will be primarily upon the application of deep learning, with some introduction to the mathematical foundations of deep learning. Students will use the Python programming language to architect a deep learning model for several of real-world data sets and interpret the results of these networks."

    "# What is Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this class is deep learning, which is a very popular type of machine learning that is based upon the original neural networks popularized in the 1980's. There is very little difference between how a deep neural network is calculated compared with the original neural network.  We've always been able to create and calculate deep neural networks.  A deep neural network is nothing more than a neural network with many layers.  While we've always been able to create/calculate deep neural networks, we've lacked an effective means of training them.  Deep learning provides an efficient means to train deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "If deep learning is a type of machine learning, this begs the question, \"What is machine learning?\"  The following diagram illustrates how machine learning differs from traditional software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ML vs Traditional Software Development](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/class_1_ml_vs_trad.png \"Machine Learning vs Traditional Software Development\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Traditional Software Development** - Programmers create programs that specify how to transform input into the desired output.\n",
    "* **Machine Learning** - Programmers create models that can learn to produce the desired output for given input. This learning fills the traditional role of the computer program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have applied machine learning to many different areas.  This class will explore three specific domains for the application of deep neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Application of Machine Learning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/class_1_ml_types.png \"Application of Machine Learning\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Predictive Modeling** - Several named input values are used to predict another named value that becomes the output.  For example, using four measurements of iris flowers to predict the species.  \n",
    "* **Computer Vision** - The use of machine learning to detect patterns in visual data.  For example, is an image a cat or a dog.\n",
    "* **Time Series** - The use of machine learning to detect patterns in in time.  Common applications of time series are: financial applications, speech recognition, and even natural language processing (NLP). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is when a model, such as a neural network, accepts input and produces a numeric output.  Consider if you were tasked to write a program that predicted how many miles per gallon (MPG) a car could achieve.  For the inputs you would probably want such features as the weight of the car, the horsepower, how large the engine is, etc.  Your program would be a combination of math and if-statements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning lets the computer learn the \"formula\" for calculating the MPG of a car, using data.  Consider [this](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/data/auto-mpg.csv) dataset.  We can use regression machine learning models to study this data and learn how to predict the MPG for a car. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a classification model is what class the input belongs to.  For example, consider using four measurements of an iris flower to determine the species that the flower is in.

    "[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.  It is based on the [dataframe](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) concept found in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).  For this class, Pandas will be the primary means by which data is manipulated in conjunction with neural networks.\n",

This dataset can be found on the UCI machine learning repository.  For this class we will use a version of the Auto MPG dataset where I added column headers.  You can find my version [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/data/auto-mpg.csv).\n",

A normalization allows numbers to be put in a standard form so that two values can easily be compared.  Consider if a friend told you that he received a $10 discount.  Is this a good deal?  Maybe.  But the value is not normalized.  If your friend purchased a car, then the discount is not that good.  If your friend purchased dinner, this is a very good discount!\n",

Most of the values are present in the MPG database.  However, there are missing values in the horsepower column.  A common practice is to replace missing values with the median value for that column.  The median is calculated as described [here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/median.html).  The following code replaces any NA values in horsepower with the median:"
