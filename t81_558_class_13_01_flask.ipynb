    "If your neural networks are to be woven into a production system they must be exposed in a way that they can be easily executed by Python and other programming languages.  The usual means for doing this is a web service. One of the most popular libraries for doing this in Python is [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/). This library allows you to quickly deploy your Python applications, including TensorFlow, as web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment is a complex process, usually carried out by a company's [Information Technology (IT) group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology).  When large numbers of clients must access your model scalability becomes important.  This is usually handled by the cloud.  Flask is not designed for high-volume systems.  When deployed to production, models will usually be wrapped in [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) or TensorFlow Serving.  High volume cloud deployment is discussed in the next chapter.  Everything presented in this part ith Flask is directly compatible with the higher volume Gunicorn system. It is common to use a development system, such as Flask, when you are developing your initial system.\n",

    "It is uncommon to run Flask from a Jupyter notebook.  Flask is the server and Jupyter usually fills the role of the client.  However, we can run a simple web service from Jupyter.  We will quickly move beyond this and deploy using a Python script (.py).  This means that it will be difficult to use Google CoLab, as you will be running from the command line.  For now, lets execute a Flask web container in Jupyter."
