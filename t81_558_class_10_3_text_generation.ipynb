However, the reason that this technology gets so much interest is that it forms the foundation for many more advanced technologies.

Similar technology can be used to complete sentences when a user is entering text.  Simply the ability to output free-form text becomes the foundation of many other technologies.  In the next part, we will make use of this technique to create a neural network that can write captions for images to describe what is going on in the image. \n", "\n", "### Additional Information\n", "\n", "The following are some of the articles that I found useful putting this section together.\n", "\n", "* [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)\n", "* [Keras LSTM Generation Example](https://keras.io/examples/lstm_text_generation/)\n", "\n", "### Character-Level Text Generation\n", "\n", "There are a number of different approaches to teaching a neural network to output free-form text.
