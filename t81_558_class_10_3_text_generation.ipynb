    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks are also known for their ability to generate text.  This can allow the output of the neural network to be free-form text.  In this part we will see how an LSTM can be trained on a textual document, such as classic literature, and learn to output new text that appears to be of the same form as the training material.  If you train your LSTM on [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare), then it will learn to crank out new prose that is similar to what Shakespeare had written. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't get your hopes up.  Your not going to each your deep neural network to write the next [Pulitzer Prize for Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Fiction).  The prose generated by your neural network will be nonsensical.  However, it will usually be nearly grammatically and of a similar style as the source training documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network generating nonsensical text based on literature may not seem terribly useful at first glance.  However, the reason that this technology gets so much interest is that it forms the foundation for many more advanced technologies.  The fact that the LSTM will typically learn human grammar from the source document opens a wide range of possibilities. Similar technology can be used to complete sentences when a user is entering text.  Simply the ability to output free-form text becomes the foundation of many other technologies.  In the next part, we will make use of this technique to create a neural network that can write captions for images to describe what is going on in the image. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Character-Level Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different approaches to teaching a neural network to output free-form text.  The most basic question is if you wish the neural network to learn at the word or character level.  In many ways, learning at the character level is the more interesting of the two.  The LSTM is learning construct its own words without even being shown what a word is.  We will begin with character-level text generation.  In the next module, we will see how we can use nearly the same technique to operate at the word level.  The automatic captioning that will be implemented in the next module is at the word level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by importing the needed Python packages and defining the sequence length, named **maxlen**.  Time-series neural networks always accept their input as a fixed length array.  Not all of the sequence might be used, it is common to fill extra elements with zeros.  The text will be divided into sequences of this length and the neural network will be trained to predict what comes after this sequence."
