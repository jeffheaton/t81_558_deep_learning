In this part, we will see that we can stop and continue and even adjust training at later times. We accomplish this continuation with checkpoints. We begin by creating several utility functions. The first utility generates an output directory that has a unique name. This technique allows us to organize multiple runs of our experiment. We provide the Logger class to route output to a log file contained in the output directory."

    "Keras provides a prebuilt checkpoint class named **ModelCheckpoint** that contains most of the functionality that we desire. This built-in class is capable of saving the model's state repeatedly as training progresses. Stopping neural network training is not always a controlled event.  Sometimes this stoppage can be abrupt, such as a power failure or a network resource shutting down.  If Microsoft Windows is your operating system of choice, your training can also be interrupted by a high-priority system update. Because of all of this uncertainty, it is best to save your model at regular intervals.  This process is similar to saving a game at critical checkpoints, so you do not have to start over if something terrible happens to your avatar in the game.\n",

    "We will create our checkpoint class, named **MyModelCheckpoint**.  In addition to saving the model, we also save the state of the training infrastructure.  Why save the training infrastructure, in addition, the weights?  This technique eases the transition back into training for the neural network and will be more efficient than a cold start.  \n",
