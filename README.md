# T81 558:Applications of Deep Neural Networks
[Washington University in St. Louis](http://www.wustl.edu)

Instructor: [Jeff Heaton](http://www.heatonresearch.com/)

Spring 2017, Mondays, class room Lopata Hall #103 

**Please note, this semester is using TensorFlow 0.12.1.**

# Course Description

Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. By using a 
combination of advanced training techniques and neural network architectural components, it 
is now possible to train neural networks of much greater complexity. This course will 
introduce the student to deep belief neural networks, regularization units (ReLU), 
convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. High performance computing 
(HPC) aspects will demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged both on graphical 
processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. Deep learning allows a model to learn 
hierarchies of information in a way that is similar to the function of the human brain. 
Focus will be primarily upon the application of deep learning, with some introduction to 
the mathematical foundations of deep learning. Students will use the Python programming 
language to architect a deep learning model for several of real-world data sets and 
interpret the results of these networks.

# Objectives

1. Explain how neural networks (deep and otherwise) compare to other machine learning models. 
2. Determine when a deep neural network would be a good choice for a particular problem.
3. Demonstrate your understanding of the material through a final project uploaded to GitHub.
