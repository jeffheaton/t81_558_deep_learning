    "Training GANs with StyleGAN is resource-intensive. For the high-resolution face GANs trained by NVIDIA, the researchers used computers with 8 high-end GPUs. The GPU used by NVIDIA is an A100, which has more memory and cores than the P100 or V100 offered by even Colab Pro+. In this part, we will use StyleGAN2 to train, rather than StyleGAN3. You can use networks trained with StyleGAN2 from StyleGAN3; however, they will not be trained as well as StyleGAN3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, StyleGAN3 is compute-intensive and will perform slowly on any GPU that is not the latest Ampere technology. Because Colab does not provide such technology, I am keeping the training guide at the StyleGAN2 level. Switching to StyleGAN3 is relatively easy, as will be pointed out later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you are running this notebook with a GPU runtime. GANs can be trained with either Google Colab Free or Pro. I recommend at least the Pro version due to better GPU instances, longer runtimes, and timeouts. Additionally, the capability of Google Colab Pro to run in the background is valuable when training GANs, as you can close your browser or reboot your laptop while training continues.\n",

I've found that Colab Pro generally starts you with a V100, however, if you run scripts non-stop for 24hrs straight for a few days in a row, you will generally be throttled back to a P100.\n",

    "You will likely need to train for >24 hours. Colab will disconnect you. You must be prepared to restart training when this eventually happens. Training is divided into ticks, every so many ticks (50 by default) your neural network is evaluated and a snapshot is saved. When CoLab shuts down, all training after the last snapshot is lost. It might seem desirable to snapshot after each tick; however, this snapshotting process itself takes nearly an hour. It is important to learn an optimal snapshot-size for your resolution and training data.\n",
