    "To do this, we will use the same API developed in Module 13.1.  However, we will now add a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) website around it. This is a single page web application that allows you to upload images for classification by the neural network.  If you would like to read more about ReactJS and image uploading, you can refer to the [blog post](http://www.hartzis.me/react-image-upload/) that I borrowed some of the code from.  I added neural network functionality to a simple ReactJS image upload and preview example.\n",
