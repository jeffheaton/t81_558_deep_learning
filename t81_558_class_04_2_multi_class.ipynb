        "Binary classification occurs when a neural network must choose between two options: true/false, yes/no, correct/incorrect, or buy/sell. To see how to use binary classification, we will consider a classification system for a credit card company. This system will either \"issue a credit card\" or \"decline a credit card.\" This classification system must decide how to respond to a new potential customer.  \n",

        "When you have only two classes that you can consider, the objective function's score is the number of false-positive predictions versus the number of false negatives. False negatives and false positives are both types of errors, and it is essential to understand the difference. For the previous example, issuing a credit card would be positive. A false positive occurs when a model decides to issue a credit card to someone who will not make payments as agreed. A false negative happens when a model denies a credit card to someone who would have made payments as agreed.  \n",

For most banks issuing credit cards, a false positive is worse than a false negative. Declining a potentially good credit card holder is better than accepting a credit card holder who would cause the bank to undertake expensive collection activities.\n",
