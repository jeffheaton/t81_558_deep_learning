    "# Part 1.3: Python Lists, Dictionaries, Sets and JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most modern programming languages, Python includes Lists, Sets, Dictionaries, and other data structures as built-in types.  The syntax appearance of both of these is similar to JSON. Python and JSON compatibility is discussed later in this module.  This course will focus primarily on Lists, Sets, and Dictionaries.  It is essential to understand the differences between these three fundamental collection types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dictionary** - A dictionary is a mutable unordered collection that Python indexes with name and value pairs.\n",
    "* **List** - A list is a mutable ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.\n",
    "* **Set** - A set is a mutable unordered collection with no duplicate elements.\n",
    "* **Tuple** - A tuple is an immutable ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Python collections are mutable, which means that the program can add and remove elements after definition.  An immutable collection cannot add or remove items after definition.  It is also essential to understand that an ordered collection means that items maintain their order as the program adds them to a collection.  This order might not be any specific ordering, such as alphabetic or numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and tuples are very similar in Python and are often confused. The significant difference is that a list is mutable, but a tuple isnâ€™t. So, we include a list when we want to contain similar items, and include a tuple when we know what information goes into it ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages contain a data collection called an array.  The array type is noticeably absent in Python.  Generally, the programmer will use a list in place of an array in Python.  Arrays in most programming languages were fixed-length, requiring the program to know the maximum number of elements needed ahead of time.  This restriction leads to the infamous array-overrun bugs and security issues.  The Python list is much more flexible in that the program can dynamically change the size of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next sections will look at each of these collection types in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists and Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Python program, lists and tuples are very similar.  It is possible to get by as a programmer using only lists and ignoring tuples.  Both lists and tuples hold an ordered collection of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difference that you will see syntactically is that a list is enclosed by square braces [] and a list is enclosed by parenthesis ().  The following code defines both list and tuple."
