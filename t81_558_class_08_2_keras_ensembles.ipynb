[[Citebreiman2001random:]](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf)  Although he presented this algorithm in conjunction with random forests, it is model-independent and appropriate for any supervised learning model.  This algorithm, known as the input perturbation algorithm, works by evaluating a trained model’s accuracy with each of the inputs individually shuffled from a data set.  Shuffling an input causes it to become useless—effectively removing it from the model. More important inputs will produce a less accurate score when they are removed by shuffling them. This process makes sense because important features will contribute to the accuracy of the model.  I first presented the TensorFlow implementation of this algorithm in the following paper.\n",

    "\n",
    "A neural network ensemble combines neural network predictions with other models. The program determines the exact blend of all of these models by logistic regression. The following code performs this blend for a classification.  If you present the final predictions from the ensemble to Kaggle, you will see that the result is very accurate."
