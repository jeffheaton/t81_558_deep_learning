    "For this assignment you will begin by loading a pretrained neural network that I provide here:  [transfer_9.h5](https://data.heatonresearch.com/data/t81-558/networks/transfer_9.h5).  You will demonstrate your ability to transfer several layers from this neural network to create a new neural network to be used for feature engineering.\n",
