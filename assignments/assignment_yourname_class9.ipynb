    "\n",
    "This assignment gives you the chance to explore some of the most advanced pretrained networks available.  Keras comes with around 20 pretrained neural networks built-in.  You can use these networks right out of the box without modification or extend these networks through transfer learning.  For this assignment, I will show you how you can explore these networks and examine their structure. This technique can be a great learning aid to see the structure of some of the most advanced neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create one of the pretrained neural networks in Keras use the **application** package.  For example, you can create the **Xception** neural network with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "net = tf.keras.applications.Xception()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the neural network structure issue the **summary** command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "net.summary()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **dir** command will tell you what methods and properties are available for the neural network.  You will use these functions to extract data from this structure.  For example, to see the first layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "net.layers[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what type the first layer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "type(net.layers[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the internals of that layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "dir(net.layers[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use these sort of commands to build a table that looks similar to this:\n",

    "|name|input|output|layers|max_layer_wgt|wgt_count|\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",

    "|VGG19|224 x 224 x 3|1000|26|98.0M|137.0M\n",
    "|...|...|...|...|...|...\n",
    "\n",
    "The meanings of these columns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **name** - The name of the network.\n",
    "* **input**\t- The count/structure of input neurons.\n",

    "* **wgt_count** - The total count of weights. (as a string)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that I do request you to output weight counts a string, such as 10M.  I provide a helper function for this.  Also note, that I do request the input structure, such as 128 x 128 x 3.  You should create a helper function of your own to format this output.\n",
