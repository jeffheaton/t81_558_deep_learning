    "This assignment is similar to assignment 5, except that you must use feature engineering to solve it.  I provide you with a dataset that contains dimensions and the quality of items of specific shapes.  With the values of 'height', 'width', 'depth'. 'shape', and 'quality' you should try to predict the cost of these items.  You should be able to match very close to solution file, if you feature engineer correctly.  To get full credit your average cost should not be more than 50 off from the solution.  The autocorrector will let you know if you are in this range.\n",
