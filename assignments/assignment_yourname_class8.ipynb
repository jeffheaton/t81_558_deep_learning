The preprocessing/feature engineering code used for this assignment will be identical to [Assignmnent 5](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/assignments/assignment_yourname_class5.ipynb), and you are encouraged to use your Assignment 5 code as a starting point.  Refer to [Module 8](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/t81_558_class8_kaggle.ipynb) for instructions on producing a Kaggle type submission file.  \n",
