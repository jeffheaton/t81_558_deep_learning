    "For this assignment you will use the **cls-32-spring-2018.csv** dataset.  This is a dataset that I generated specifically for this semester.  You can find the CSV file in the **data** directory of the class GitHub repository here: [cls-32-spring-2018.csv](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/data/cls-32-spring-2018.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will train 5 neural networks, one for each fold of a 5-fold cross validation and return the out of sample predictions.  You will submit these perdictions to the **submit** function.  See [Assignment #1](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/assignments/assignment_yourname_class1.ipynb) for details on how to submit an assignment or check that one was submitted.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Normalize all numerics to zscores and all text/categoricals to dummies.  Normalize the *target* to an index (use *encode_text_index*).\n",
    "* Your target (y) is the filed named *target*.\n",
    "* If you find any missing values (NA's), replace them with the median values for that column.\n",
    "* This is a larger dataset with rows of nearly 100K.  Training will take longer but it should not take you longer than 20 minutes or so to train.  If it is taking longer, use a more simple neural network.\n",
    "* To save some time, modify the training set to be short, say 100 lines, and use that to debug your code and use the full set the end.  No need to waste 20 minutes just to see you have an error generating the submit data frame.\n",
    "* Use a 5-fold cross validation and return out of sample predictions.  \n",
    "* Your submission should contain the id (column name *id*), your prediction (column name *pred*), the expected value (from the **cls-32-spring-2018.csv** dataset. Note that both *pred* and *y* should be in index form (i.e. 1,2,3,4 etc, not the text form, TA-0, TA-1, etc)\n",
    "* You might get warnings about the means of your columns differing from mine.  Do not worry about small differences.  \n",
