    "Your code should work with any image; however, these are the two that the **submit** function is expecting.  The goal is to convert both images into square-sized.  In this module we saw how to convert to a square by cropping.  This time we will convert to a square by adding space.  If an image is [landscape orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_orientation) you will need to add space at the top and bottom.  Similarly for portrait (taller than wide) you will add space at the sides.  Make sure that the image is centered between the space. \n",

    "To calculate the color to add to the space, take the average of all RGB values.  Essentially sum all the red values, green, and blue and divide by total number of pixels.  Notice how the darker landscape picture above has a darker color added to the above/below space?  This is due to this averaging.  Make sure you convert your average RGB to integer, RGB does not have fractional values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submit function will check to see if your height and width match my solution.  If your height and width are non-square or do not match my dimensions, you likely have a problem with your assignment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The submit function also takes three pixels and tests them.  Pixels 1 and 3 are the upper left and lower-right, these are the average color and should match my solution exactly. You might see a difference in pixel 2, which is in the center, if you center the image differently than I do.  If you want to match my solution, make sure to round to integer after any divisions. \n"
