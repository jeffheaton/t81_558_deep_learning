    "For this assignment you will use the MINST dataset to train and predict several handwritten digits.  For the creation and training of the neural network, you can [copy the code](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/t81_558_class7_cnn.ipynb) from class for much of this assignment.  Use the provided code to download the training and testing data for the handwritten digits and predict the following **testing set** digits (10,20,30,40,50):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Index 10: which is the digit '0'\n",
    "* Index 20: which is the digit '9'\n",
    "* Index 30: which is the digit '3'\n",
    "* Index 40: which is the digit '1'\n",
    "* Index 50: which is the digit '6'\n",
    "\n",
    "You will predict these 5 digits. You will submit these perdictions to the submit function. See [Assignment #1]() for details on how to submit an assignment or check that one was submitted. Your submitted dataframe should have 5 data rows (one offor each of the indexes).  You should have the columns **id**, **pred**, and **y**.  The column **id** specifies which index the prediction is for (10, 20, 30, 40, 50).  The column **pred** is your prediction (0-9).  The column **y** is the actual digit for that index (0-9).  Your sumission will only have 5 rows and might look something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "id | pred | y\n",
    "---|---|---\n",
    "10 | 0 | 0\n",
    "20 | 9 | 9\n",
    "30 | 3 | 3\n",
    "40 | 1 | 1\n",
    "50 | 6 | 6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important suggestion** You will likely see training times upwards of an hour.  Place your training code in a different cell than your code to get predictions and submit.  Otherwise you will have to retrain for every test of your network, and that will take forever!  You can also save your trained neural network to a binary file and reload it."
