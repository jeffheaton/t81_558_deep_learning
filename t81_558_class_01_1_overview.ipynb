    "Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. [[Cite:lecun2015deep]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539) By using a combination of advanced training techniques neural network architectural components, it is now possible to train neural networks of much greater complexity. This course introduces the student to deep belief neural networks, regularization units (ReLU), convolution neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. High-performance computing (HPC) aspects demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged both on graphical processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. Deep learning allows a model to learn hierarchies of information in a way that is similar to the function of the human brain. The focus is primarily upon the application of deep learning, with some introduction to the mathematical foundations of deep learning. Students make use of the Python programming language to architect a deep learning model for several real-world data sets and interpret the results of these networks.

    "# What is Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this class is deep learning, which is a prevalent type of machine learning that builds upon the original neural networks popularized in the 1980s. There is very little difference between how a deep neural network is calculated compared with the first neural network.  We've always been able to create and calculate deep neural networks.  A deep neural network is nothing more than a neural network with many layers.  While we've always been able to create/calculate deep neural networks, we've lacked an effective means of training them.  Deep learning provides an efficient means to train deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "If deep learning is a type of machine learning, this begs the question, \"What is machine learning?\"  Figure 1.ML-DEV  illustrates how machine learning differs from traditional software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1.ML-DEV: ML vs Traditional Software Development**\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Traditional Software Development** - Programmers create programs that specify how to transform input into the desired output.\n",
    "* **Machine Learning** - Programmers create models that can learn to produce the desired output for given input. This learning fills the traditional role of the computer program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have applied machine learning to many different areas.  This class explores three specific domains for the application of deep neural networks, as illustrated in Figure 1.ML-DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1.ML-DOM: Application of Machine Learning**\n",

    "* **Predictive Modeling** - Several named input values allow the neural network to predict another named value that becomes the output.  For example, using four measurements of iris flowers to predict the species.  This type of data is often called tabular data.\n",
    "* **Computer Vision** - The use of machine learning to detect patterns in visual data.  For example, is an image a picture of a cat or a dog.\n",
    "* **Time Series** - The use of machine learning to detect patterns in time. Typical applications of time series are financial applications, speech recognition, and even natural language processing (NLP). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is when a model, such as a neural network, accepts input, and produces a numeric output.  Consider if you must to write a program that predicted how many miles per gallon (MPG) a car could achieve.  For the inputs, you would probably want such features as the weight of the car, the horsepower, how large the engine is, and other values.  Your program would be a combination of math and if-statements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning lets the computer learn the \"formula\" for calculating the MPG of a car, using data.  Consider [this](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/data/auto-mpg.csv) dataset.  We can use regression machine learning models to study this data and learn how to predict the MPG for a car. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a classification model is what class the input most closely resembles.  For example, consider using four measurements of an iris flower to determine the likely species that the flower.  The [iris dataset](https://data.heatonresearch.com/data/t81-558/iris.csv) is a typical dataset for machine learning examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Beyond Classification and Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most potent aspects of neural networks is that a neural network can be both regression and classification at the same time.  The output from a neural network could be any number of the following:\n",

    "## What are Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are one of the earliest examples of a machine learning model.  Neural networks were initially introduced in the 1940s and have risen and fallen several times from popularity. The current generation of deep learning begain in 2006 with an improved training algorithm by Geoffrey Hinton. [[Cite:hinton2006fast]](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527) This technique finally allowed neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to be efficiently trained. Four researchers have contributed significantly to the development of neural networks.  They have consistently pushed neural network research, both through the ups and downs.
