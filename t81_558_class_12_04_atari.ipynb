    "The Atari 2600 is a home video game console from Atari, Inc., Released on September 11, 1977. Most credit the Atari with popularizing microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on ROM cartridges instead of dedicated hardware with games built into the unit. Atari bundled their console with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge: initially [Combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_(Atari_2600)), and later [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_(Atari_2600)).\n",

    "This chapter demonstrates playing [Atari Pong](https://github.com/wau/keras-rl2/blob/master/examples/dqn_atari.py). Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; you earn points when one fails to return it to the other. For the Atari 2600 version of Pong, a computer player (controlled by the Atari 2600) is the opposing player.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section shows how to adapt TF-Agents to an Atari game. You can quickly adapt this example to any Atari game by simply changing the environment name. However, I tuned the code presented here for Pong, and it may not perform as well for other games. Some tuning will likely be necessary to produce a good agent for other games. Compared to the pole-cart game presented earlier in this chapter, some changes are required.\n",
