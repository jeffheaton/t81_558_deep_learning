    "* No pre-processing was applied to training images besides scaling to the range of the tanh activation function [-1, 1]. \n",
    "* All models were trained with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a mini-batch size of 128. \n",
    "* All weights were initialized from a zero-centered Normal distribution with standard deviation 0.02. \n",
    "* In the LeakyReLU, the slope of the leak was set to 0.2 in all models.\n",
    "* we used the Adam optimizer(Kingma & Ba, 2014) with tuned hyperparameters. We found the suggested learning rate of 0.001, to be too high, using 0.0002 instead. \n",
    "* Additionally, we found leaving the momentum term $\\beta{1}$ at the suggested value of 0.9 resulted in training oscillation and instability while reducing it to 0.5 helped stabilize training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper also provides the following architecture guidelines for stable Deep Convolutional GANs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Replace any pooling layers with strided convolutions (discriminator) and fractional-strided convolutions (generator).\n",

    "Loss functions must be developed that allow the generator and discriminator to be trained in an adversarial way.  Because these two neural networks are being trained independently they must be trained in two separate passes.  This requires two separate loss functions and also two separate updates to the gradients.  When the discriminator's gradients are applied to decrease the discriminator's loss it is important that only the discriminator's weights are update.  It is not fair, nor will it produce good results, to adversarially damage the weights of the generator to help the discriminator.  A simple backpropagation would do this.  It would simultaneously affect the weights of both generator and discriminator to lower whatever loss it was assigned to lower.\n",
