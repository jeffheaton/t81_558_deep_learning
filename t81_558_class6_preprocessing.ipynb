    "# Why is Preprocessing Necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature vector, the input to a model (such as a neural network), must be completely numeric. Converting non-numeric data into numeric is one major component of preprocessing.  It is also often important to preprocess numeric values.  Scikit-learn provides a large number of preprocessing functions: \n",

    "Financial forecasting is a very popular form of temporal algorithm. A temporal algorithm is one that accepts input for values that range over time. If the algorithm supports short term memory (internal state) then ranges over time are supported automatically. If your algorithm does not have an internal state then you should use an input window and a prediction window. Most algorithms do not have an internal state. To see how to use these windows, consider if you would like the algorithm to predict the stock market. You begin with the closing price for a stock over several days:\n",

    "The first step is to normalize the data. This is necessary whether your algorithm has internal state or not. To normalize, we want to change each number into the percent movement from the previous day. For example, day 2 would become 0.04, because there is a 4% difference between $45 and $47. Once you perform this calculation for every day, the data set will look like the following:\n",

    "In order to create an algorithm that will predict the next day’s values, we need to think about how to encode this data to be presented to the algorithm. The encoding depends on whether the algorithm has an internal state. The internal state allows the algorithm to use the last few values inputted to help establish trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms have no internal state. If this is the case, then you will typically use a sliding window algorithm to encode the data. To do this, we use the last three prices to predict the next one. The inputs would be the last three-day prices, and the output would be the fourth day. The above data could be organized in the following way to provide training data.\n",
