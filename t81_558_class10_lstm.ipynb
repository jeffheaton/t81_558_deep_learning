    "# Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "So far the neural networks that we’ve examined have always had forward connections.  The input layer always connects to the first hidden layer.  Each hidden layer always connects to the next hidden layer.  The final hidden layer always connects to the output layer.  This manner to connect layers is the reason that these networks are called “feedforward.”  Recurrent neural networks are not so rigid, as backward connections are also allowed. A recurrent connection links a neuron in a layer to either a previous layer or the neuron itself.  Most recurrent neural network architectures maintain state in the recurrent connections.  Feedforward neural networks don’t maintain any state.  A recurrent neural network’s state acts as a sort of short-term memory for the neural network.  Consequently, a recurrent neural network will not always produce the same output for a given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks do not force the connections to flow only from one layer to the next, from input layer to output layer.  A recurrent connection occurs when a connection is formed between a neuron and one of the following other types of neurons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The neuron itself\n",
    "* A neuron on the same level\n",
    "* A neuron on a previous level\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent connections can never target the input neurons or the bias neurons.  \n",
    "The processing of recurrent connections can be challenging. Because the recurrent links create endless loops, the neural network must have some way to know when to stop.  A neural network that entered an endless loop would not be useful.  To prevent endless loops, we can calculate the recurrent connections with the following three approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Context neurons\n",
    "* Calculating output over a fixed number of iterations\n",
    "* Calculating output until neuron output stabilizes\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to neural networks that use context neurons as a simple recurrent network (SRN).  The context neuron is a special neuron type that remembers its input and provides that input as its output the next time that we calculate the network.  For example, if we gave a context neuron 0.5 as input, it would output 0.  Context neurons always output 0 on their first call.  However, if we gave the context neuron a 0.6 as input, the output would be 0.5.  We never weight the input connections to a context neuron, but we can weight the output from a context neuron just like any other connection in a network.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Context neurons allow us to calculate a neural network in a single feedforward pass.  Context neurons usually occur in layers.  A layer of context neurons will always have the same number of context neurons as neurons in its source layer, as demonstrated here:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Context Layers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/class_10_context_layer.png \"Context Layers\")\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the above layer, two hidden neurons that are labeled hidden 1 and hidden 2 directly connect to the two context neurons.  The dashed lines on these connections indicate that these are not weighted connections. These weightless connections are never dense.  If these connections were dense, hidden 1 would be connected to both hidden 1 and hidden 2.  However, the direct connection simply joins each hidden neuron to its corresponding context neuron.  The two context neurons form dense, weighted connections to the two hidden neurons.  Finally, the two hidden neurons also form dense connections to the neurons in the next layer.  The two context neurons would form two connections to a single neuron in the next layer, four connections to two neurons, six connections to three neurons, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine context neurons with the input, hidden, and output layers of a neural network in many different ways.  In the next two sections, we explore two common SRN architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1990, Elman introduced a neural network that provides pattern recognition to time series.  This neural network type has one input neuron for each stream that you are using to predict.  There is one output neuron for each time slice you are trying to predict.  A single-hidden layer is positioned between the input and output layer.  A layer of context neurons takes its input from the hidden layer output and feeds back into the same hidden layer.  Consequently, the context layers always have the same number of neurons as the hidden layer, as demonstrated here:  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Elman Neural Network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/class_10_elman.png \"Elman Neural Network\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elman neural network is a good general-purpose architecture for simple recurrent neural networks.  You can pair any reasonable number of input neurons to any number of output neurons.  Using normal weighted connections, the two context neurons are fully connected with the two hidden neurons.  The two context neurons receive their state from the two non-weighted connections (dashed lines) from each of the two hidden neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation through time works by unfolding the SRN to become a regular neural network.  To unfold the SRN, we construct a chain of neural networks equal to how far back in time we wish to go.  We start with a neural network that contains the inputs for the current time, known as t.  Next we replace the context with the entire neural network, up to the context neuron’s input.  We continue for the desired number of time slices and replace the final context neuron with a 0.  The following diagram shows an unfolded Elman neural network for two time slices.\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are inputs for both t (current time) and t-1 (one time slice in the past).  The bottom neural network stops at the hidden neurons because you don’t need everything beyond the hidden neurons to calculate the context input.  The bottom network structure becomes the context to the top network structure.  Of course, the bottom structure would have had a context as well that connects to its hidden neurons.  However, because the output neuron above does not contribute to the context, only the top network (current time) has one.\n"
